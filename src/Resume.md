## **Experience**

**Senior Software Engineer**  
*Aegis Premier Technologies | September 2019 - Current*

I work on a team that is maintaining a suite of software that serves the non-profit print and mail industries. We have a large monolithic MVC app, Windows desktop apps, web services, apis, and an Angular 6 app under our purview. Most of the work I perform is refactoring legacy codebases to support larger amounts of data as the needs of the systems grow.

**Software Engineer**  
*Pacific Medical Data Solutions | November 2018 - September 2019*

I worked on small team that produced an application to calculate payroll for physicians. It is a highly available, distributed application that served all hospitals in our network. Our stack was comprised of .Net Core and Node applications that communicated through Azure Service Bus. I contributed in all areas of front-end and back-end code, and I was an integral part in creating and maintaining our Kubernetes infrastructure and CI / CD pipelines.

**Software Engineer & Site Reliability Engineer**  
*Trimble | March 2018 - November 2018*

I used containers and Kubernetes to create highly available services to improve and replace parts of existing infrastructure. I worked on a team that produced a web dashboard displaying near real time information about construction equipment on job sites out in the world. The stack is comprised of microservices built around the Kafka messaging platform. I worked to maintain existing code as well as created new apps and microservices. I worked with code across all layers of the stack that included front end AngularJS, .Net APIs, back end data processing microservices, and data storage layers of various flavors.

**Software Engineer & Team Lead**  
*Aegis Premier Technologies | July 2016 - March 2018*

I worked to rebuild a legacy .NET application using .NET Core and Angular 5. We used a distributed architecture that communicates through REST APIs. I developed in all areas of the stack and provided support to other groups for the existing application when needed. As team lead, I hosted the daily scrum ceremonies and help to clear blockers for my team.

**Lead Web Programmer**  
*Stellar Blue Technologies | August 2015 - September 2016*

I worked as a PHP full stack developer and created advanced WordPress themes and plugins. I extended functionality of existing projects, created, and deployed new projects regularly. We used a traditional LAMP stack, SCSS, jQuery, and Gulp tasks to deliver our products. Many of the sites I created are still active.

## **Education**

**A.A.S. in Software Development**  
*Fox Valley Technical College | May 2015*

Curriculum based in C# application development on desktop and mobile platforms with additional work in PHP web development.
